Creating in C language a way to treat the complex numbers

The C language does not have a data type for global numbers. Knowing this, your task is to write a program (and a set of functions) that performs operations on complex numbers.

Your program should offer a menu that asks the user if he wants to insert global numbers into a vector, print a complex number, or even if he wants to perform basic mathematical operations on two complex numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).

For this program, consider that complexes will always be represented in their rectangular (or Cartesian) form, that is, they will always appear in the form "x + yi".
